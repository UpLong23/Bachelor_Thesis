# Bachelor Thesis
This bachelor's thesis examines topics of Projective Geometry, which will be addressed through Linear Algebra. In particular, the concept of projective space is defined as the set of all one-dimensional vector subspaces of a vector space.
Firstly, we introduce the projective transformations through which we prove the two major theorems of Projective Geometry: Desargues’ theorem and Pappus’ theorem. 
Secondly, we study one of the most important concepts of Projective Geometry: the notion of duality. It is through duality that Projective Geometry can offer a wider range of possibilities if compared to Euclidian Geometry. 
Thirdly, we define the projective plane curves in a projective plane as well as the homogeneous polynomials so that we can classify the second-degree algebraic curves (conic sections) in a projective plane.
Finally, we study the cubic curves with a view to define elliptic curves. The latter can be applied on the elliptic curve cryptosystems, which are the state-of-the art sytems used in modern asymmetric cryptography.
